# Halo_GZDoomVer
 ##### Part of a bigger multi-person HaloDoom project.
 ###### This is the GZDoom port, it's pretty much backup for my side of things.
 
 
 If you're viewing this GitHub, this was intended to be a sort of "easter-egg" find for those with the technical know-how to do so.
 If you're here from YouTube or some other website currently, I ask that you please do not post the link around for the time being.
 This repo and readme will be editted once the mod is fully released. As per now, keep in mind that HaloDoom Evolved is VERY work-in-progress 
 and subject to frequent changes/complete balancing overhauls.
